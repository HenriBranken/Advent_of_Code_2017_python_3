for shedding light on solving: day_13 and day_23.

This repository contains my personally-crafted solutions to the Advent of Code 2017 challenge.
Refer to the original website --> https://adventofcode.com/ <-- for more details.

As I commented in my solution files, these solutions do not necessarily represent the most optimized solution to the AoC problems.
The solutions merely represent the solution that I came up with at the time using Python 3.

Mostly imperative programming was used to solve the challenges, although some solutions also employ object-oriented programming.

It is highly advisable to view the Python files in the PyCharm IDE, see --> https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/ <--.
PyCharm is a very competent Full-featured IDE for Python & Web development.

# Advent_of_Code_2017_python_3
Repository containing my personally-crafted Python 3 solutions for Advent of Code (AoC) 2017.

Acknowledgements are due to Michael Gilliland @ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnw33kRSHT8736gwEERDswA
as well as Quint Daenen @ http://quint.ulyssis.be/content/AdventOfCode17
for giving me insight on solving: day_13, day_23, and day_24.

A heartfelt thank you also to Willie le Grange who first introduced me to AoC in mid December 2017.

This repository contains my personally-crafted solutions to the Advent of Code 2017 challenge.
Refer to the original website --> https://adventofcode.com/ <-- for more details.

As I commented in my solution files, these solutions do not necessarily represent the most optimized solution to the AoC problems.
The solutions merely represent the solution that I came up with at the time using Python 3.

Mostly imperative programming was used to solve the challenges, although some solutions also employ object-oriented programming.

Great care has also been taken to explain the logic, in human-readable format, behind the Python code.
If you're stuck, try to follow along the comments (preceded by a #) I left in the .py solution files.

Each "day folder" contains the following files (let's use day_01 for illustration purposes):
[i]   day_01_a.py  ==> the solution to Part 1 of the problem.
[ii]  day_01_b.py  ==> the solution to Part 2 of the problem (note however that day_25 does not have a Part 2).
[iii] day_01_input.txt ==> The puzzle input that needs to be loaded by day_01_{a, b}.py.  In the case a folder does not contain this file (e.g. day_03), then the puzzle input is stored in day_01_{a, b}.py itself.
[iv]  day_01_puzzle.txt ==> A description of the problem that needs to be solved.

It is highly advisable to view the Python files in the PyCharm IDE, see --> https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/ <--.
PyCharm is a very competent Full-featured IDE for Python & Web development.
